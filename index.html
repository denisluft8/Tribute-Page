        <h3 id="headline"> Here's some facts and achievments of Antônieta de Barros's life </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Born in Florianópolis, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina on July 17, 1901.</li>
            <li>Raised by her mother, a washerwomen and freedwoman.</li>
            <li>In 1922 found a literacy course, named "Curso Particular Antonieta de Barros"(Antonieta de Barros
                Private Course).</li>
            <li>In several speeches affirms that education is the way for the future: To educate is to teach others to
                live; it is to illuminate the paths of others; it is to support the weakened, making them strong. it is
                to show the paths, point out the climbs, making it possible to advance, without crutches and without
                stumbling; it is to transport the souls that the Lord entrusts to us, to the unsurpassed strenght of
                Faith. </li>
            <li>She founded and directed the journal "A Semana" between the years of 1922 and 1927 and is considered the
                first black woman to work in the press of the state of Santa Catarina. During this period, through her
                chronicles, she circulated her ideas, principally those linked to questions of education, oppressive
                policies, the feminine condition, and racial prejudice.</li>
            <li>She also directed a biweekly magazine "Vida Ilhoa" in 1930, and wrote various articles for local
                journals.</li>
            <li>In 1937, under the pseudonym Maria da Ilha, she wrote her book Farrapos de Ideias (Farrap, those of
                Ideas), the first book published by a black woman in the state of Santa Catarina</li>
            <li>Joined policits in 1934.</li>
            <li>Was the first woman to be elected in the state of Santa Catarina.</li>
            <li>Was the first black female state deputy in the country.</li>
            <li>Antonieta de Barros left a considerable amount of written production and always opted for the press as a
                way to reach a growing number of readers.</li>
            <li>In her work there are aspects of everyday life in the city, comments on national events and, above all,
                teachings of a moral nature.</li>
            <li>Was concerned about pacifism, the need for a national literacy campaign, social differences and gender
                roles. Her concerns were focused on social issues in which she always sought to leave teachings as a
                contribution to educational growth.</li>
            <li>From Antonieta's perspective, the educational system was flawed and for her the government was concerned
                with teaching literacy, but not with enabling citizens to continue their studies, especially in the less
                favored classes and among women.</li>
            <li>For her it was necessary to make education accessible to all people, and moral and educational
                independence would only be achieved with culture.</li>
            <li>Died at the age of 50, in 1952</li>

                <p>She is an icon. If she had been born outside Brazil, she would be a world icon, but as she was born
                    in Brazil, which is a racist country, it is necessary to fight hard for her to be seen as a
                    representation in politics for everyone, not just black people.</p>
